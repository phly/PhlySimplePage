# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 2.0.0 - TBD

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- The package now requires a minimum PHP version of 7.2.

- The package now targets the Laminas MVC, and not the Zend Framework MVC.  Additionally, it is pinned to the latest stable releases, which means it no longer supports v2 releases of laminas-mvc.

- `PhlySimplePage\PageCacheService` was renamed to `PhlySimplePage\PageCacheFactory`, and its `createService()` method renamed to `__invoke()`.

- `PhlySimplePage\PageCacheListenerService` was renamed to `PhlySimplePage\PageCacheListenerFactory`, and its `createService()` method renamed to `__invoke()`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- The package removes support for zend-mvc-console tooling in favor of the vendor binary (`phly-simple-page`) provided. This includes removal of the `PhlySimplePage\CacheController` and its factory.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 1.1.0 - 2020-02-03

### Added

- Adds a vendor script, `phly-simple-page`, with the single command `cache:clear`. When called without options, it clears the whole cache; when called with a `--page` option, it will clear only the cache for that page.

- Adds package configuration to opt-in to either zend-component-installer or laminas-component-installer in order to automate registration of the module in MVC applications during installation.

### Changed

- Updates dependencies to latest stable versions of all packages. This means both the latest `2.*` and `3.*` releases for zend-mvc, zend-eventmanager, and zend-servicemanager. If you were using this on earlier versions, you may need to update your application before you can use the latest version.

### Deprecated

- Deprecates usage of MVC console actions as provided in the `CacheController`. Users should switch to the phly-simple-page vendor binary instead.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#12](https://github.com/phly/PhlySimplePage/pull/12) fixes listener registration in the PageCacheListener to ensure the listeners can actually be removed.
